# College Programming Assignments ðŸŽ“ðŸ’»

This repository holds my college programming assignments and practice projects for C++ and Python. It covers foundational concepts, focusing on practical applications and simple algorithms.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- **C++_AddSubs.cpp**: Basic calculator program for addition and subtraction in C++, focusing on foundational syntax and arithmetic.
- **const_c++.cpp**: Demonstrates C++ constructors (default, parameterized, and copy) with examples, helping to understand object-oriented concepts.
- **student_record.py**: Python script for managing student attendance and scores, including features to calculate attendance rates and find highest/lowest scores.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Plans
Planning to add more complex C++ programs and Python scripts to reinforce core concepts.
